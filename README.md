# Wave Function Collapse for Minetest

Thanks to [this video](https://youtu.be/2SuvO4Gi7uY) for introducing me to this
algorithim, and for making a simple explanation of it.

If a change to the library improoves speed at the nessisary cost of
compatibility - the change will be made.

To ensure maximum speed, this libarary plans on making full use of new features
in Minetest as they come out.
